# Kanban process (muse)

This repo's board lives in `./kanban/` (this directory's child). This file
is deliberately outside the task tree, so process guidance is not projected
as a card.

## Tool

Canonical source Rheos discovers `openhax.kanban.edn`; the published
`eta-mu` CLI installed here discovers the synchronized JSON compatibility
mirror. Both select:

```json
{
  "tasksDir": "./docs/agile/kanban",
  "fsm": "promethean"
}
```

Run everything from the repo root.

## Card anatomy

One markdown file per card, named `<uuid>.md`, YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
uuid: "<uuid v4>"
title: "Imperative title"
status: incoming        # Promethean initial state
priority: P1            # P0..P3
labels: area, 3sp
created_at: "<ISO-8601>"
points: 3
category: audit         # free-form grouping
---
```

The example shows a CLI-produced card, not mandatory metadata for every
Markdown input. Hand-authored cards are supported: `uuid:` is canonical identity;
use comma-separated scalar labels and write scope/acceptance as Markdown.
Creation metadata and `write-id` are engine provenance when present. Do not
invent an engine event for a manually authored card. Rheos owns interpretation,
operational status, comments and transitions; no local validator or alternate
board command is authorized by this authoring support.

A harness without Rheos may inspect and author content but cannot validate the
board or mutate its operational state. This distinction follows the user's
canonical global contract and resolves the repeated restoration-card critique.

Body is markdown. `---` on its own line after the frontmatter toggles
comment sections (muted in the web UI) — `eta-mu kanban comment` appends
these for provenance.

## Statuses

`icebox → incoming → accepted → breakdown → ready → todo → in_progress → testing → review → document → done`
(`blocked` for scoped impediments, `rejected` for dead ends, and `archived`
for terminal storage).

The CLI's `frontmatter <uuid> status <new>` delegates to Rheos and enforces
the configured FSM, WIP limits, and transition gates. Walk lawful edges;
don't edit status frontmatter directly.

## Loop

1. `eta-mu kanban count` / `list` — board state.
2. `eta-mu kanban search "topic"` — don't duplicate cards.
3. Walk a ready card through `todo` to `in_progress`, then
   `comment <uuid> "plan/progress"` so the ledger of intent travels with
   the card.
4. Finish through `review` → `document` → `done`.

## State

- Rheos writes through `docs/agile/kanban/.events`, a symlink whose physical
  target is `.ημ/kanban-events`. Never replace it with a ledger under docs.
- Muse's historical Receipt River remains the existing repo-root
  `receipts.edn`; do not relocate or rewrite its prior entries.
- Not Trello. `sync trello`/`sync github` exist upstream but are not part
  of this repo's process.

## Web UI

```
eta-mu kanban serve --tasks-dir docs/agile/kanban --port 8791
