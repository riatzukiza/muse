# Complete immutable review input

License: GPL-3.0-or-later.

This is bounded, user-authorized preparation in an isolated worktree at Muse18
`19456bb4c5f4d5ce1ac52ca854221516302e0c2e`. No commit, push, review request or
merge is authorized in this slice. Manual incoming card:
`0bd45066-9d1c-4cc4-a28e-fcfecf7eac7a`; no lifecycle or engine event is claimed.
After the parent merged Muse18, the isolated branch was fast-forwarded to the
existing merge `68d0e53d1369c1c0577fc3eacedb6a1b402b2f30`. Its tree is identical
to 19456; no repair commit or history rewrite occurred.

## Failure and historical evidence

The old prompt bounded reads to candidate risk zones, and eta-mu's b5 workflow
replaced its full diff with a 300,000-byte preview. Empty confirmed findings
could therefore produce approval after incomplete input.

Historical native `.agents` #8 review `5402360561` was COMMENTED on
`5c85ba67e49d8dd994faacb083e446909affa8ba` at `2026-10-03T19:16:42Z`, describing
23 of 40 staged files. Review `5402523716` was APPROVED on
`a064989a94f648859062051d55d389819294543a` at `2026-10-03T20:08:40Z`, explicitly
describing 22 of 40 files and a 300,000/664,183-byte truncated diff. Both were
submitted by `eta-mu-ai[bot]`. These are incomplete historical reviews, not
qualification for this repair. The retained a064 context records effective
Muse `05b4f1c5e5bf2297bccf113a56c17e246d769d47`.

Caller source remains intentionally pinned to
`b5b28237c45323cdc1914317260192163d957735`. Paired eta-mu preparation starts at
merged #339 `b18764d47c0b8da0b2d31f02d8bdd889323ee65c`. These ancestry and input
identities are distinct from the unpublished repair source.

## Repair

The existing Node filesystem boundary checks schema, fixed full-input path,
commit identities, byte count and SHA-256, then decodes UTF-8 without loss.
Missing or corrupt input refuses `review_begin`; beginning a new pass clears
the current prior session and its owned submission output before verification.
No fallback can treat `pr.diff` as complete input. This also defensively covers
the parent's conditional reuse concern; production reachability of that old
concern is not asserted as a proven Muse18 defect.

The existing pure `.cljc` review session partitions verified text into lossless
pages of at most 8,192 UTF-16 units or 128 lines, retaining surrogate pairs.
`review_read_diff_chunk` records delivery; `review_assess_diff_chunk` records
the reviewer's separate changed-hunk assessment. Submission requires every
page to be assessed. The envelope retains source manifest, coverage counts and
page offsets/notes; assessment events retain their notes and timestamps.

The prompt requires every changed hunk to be assessed, with relevant surrounding
code as needed. It does not demand exhaustive proof or every unchanged file.
Candidate validation, added-head-line rules, Git-quoted Unicode identity and
deterministic publisher semantics remain in their existing owners. No parallel
review engine or board implementation is introduced.

## Actual local verification

- Frozen baseline reproducer: 1 test / 2 assertions, 2 semantic failures,
  0 errors, exit 1. The original pre-repair targeted suite also had 2 semantic
  failures (18 tests / 73 assertions). Both demonstrate partial approval.
- A separate compiled-tool RED fixture proves that a failed second begin could
  retain an earlier submission file. The final fixture requires both session
  reset and absence of any stale publishable output.
- Targeted pure domain: 20 tests / 81 assertions, zero failures/errors.
- Full compiled Muse suite: 208 tests / 565 assertions, zero failures/errors;
  test compilation has zero warnings.
- Filesystem tests reject deleted tails, same-length corruption, redirected
  paths, missing files/manifests and invalid UTF-8; exact restored bytes pass.
- `npm run test:review-input`: cold actual eight-tool profile, 204 reader pages;
  missing tail and prefix-only submission refuse, all recovered pages assessed
  submit APPROVE. The unchanged publisher accepts that envelope. Invalid begin
  cannot reuse the prior completed session or submission. No model or GitHub
  write occurs.
- Eta-mu's actual observer compilation step runs against this Muse source and
  checks all 22 runtime tools and permission entries, with zero warnings.
- Publisher tests: 10/10. Full lint: zero errors/warnings. All three declared
  cold host builds pass with shared dependencies and isolated publish homes.
- Babashka exercises the portable lossless Unicode paging law.

Verification commands and durable logs are recorded with append-only receipts
under the repair evidence directory
`/home/err/spaces/review-repair/.ημ/full-input-preparation-20261003/`.
The frozen baseline proof is `/tmp/muse-full-input-red/` and is copied there.
Local fixture coverage does not certify native model review or approval.

## Release checkpoint

The new workflow and Muse profile must be qualified and selected together.
An old Muse profile lacks the reader tools; an old workflow lacks the required
full-input manifest. Eta-mu's current default Muse selection remains 05b in
this uncommitted preparation. After committing the corrected Muse source,
parent selects that immutable commit at all three eta-mu selection sites and
publishes the workflow candidate for joint native qualification. Muse need
not merge first: eta-mu's own PR workflow can check out the exact candidate
commit. Existing callers remain on b5 until both candidates qualify and merge,
followed by a separately reviewed functional revision update.

Parent owns exact-head hosted checks/reviews, findings settlement, release
selection and subsequent merge decisions. No paid credits, quota retries,
provider watcher changes or additional historical repair rounds are requested.
The existing 20,754-byte receipt prefix has SHA-256
`d0fd2f0761438833727ceb87dd4361811a1a49cf3c2ca6cd1b5509785ab1c7f2`.
Historical receipts and board events are preserved byte-for-byte.

## Muse19 native review follow-up

At exact head `1e2e63369c9fccb309e6788641b0d290ac2313aa`, CodeRabbit review
`5403507228` selected all 15 changed files and posted three findings:
`4175445588` (P2, retry wording), `4175445594` (P1, paired staging/tool contract),
and `4175445601` (P1, coverage before entering `:publish`). Manual request
`5974714381` completed in native reply `5974715275`; aggregate `5974665393`
contains exact-head reviewed coverage and retains the actionable concerns.
This is full review evidence, not a passing CodeRabbit verdict.

MiMo review `5403513175`, by `eta-mu-ai[bot]`, formally approved the same head
and explicitly reports all 15 files and the complete final hunk, with no
confirmed findings. Artifact `11288510167` from run `37162421833` retains a
52,968-byte `pr.diff` exactly equal to the full base/head Git diff, SHA-256
`6b39d0ef14e1e8d376e9cc65a98f2526124a1521a61cda39c3db51b05d3e4159`.
There is no standalone truncation marker. Its two needs-human observations
(producer identity binding and marker grammar), test-gap notes and deployment
caveats remain distinguishable from confirmed defects. Native test, bundle,
CodeRabbit and the MiMo evidence/review/terminal jobs all passed on that old
head. Codex quota comment `5974664917` supplies no approval or round credit.
These records do not qualify the corrected source after a new commit.

The follow-up keeps the existing one-pass engine and candidate restriction.
The reviewer may retry failed input admission after restoring the input.
A shared full-input guard rejects the transition to `:publish` as well as
submission until complete input has been assessed. Rejected transitions leave
the prior session intact at `:adversarial-validate`, so a recovered tail finding
can be proposed and classified without restarting.

Actual local RED: 22 tests / 95 assertions, four semantic failures and zero
errors on the old domain; the cold compiled tool fixture independently failed
because an unassessed tail entered `:publish`. GREEN: 22 / 95, zero failures or
errors; the actual eight-tool, 204-page fixture rejects premature publish,
retains a recovered blocking tail finding in REQUEST_CHANGES, and still
accepts a separate complete clean generation as APPROVE. Both are synthetic
envelopes with no native publication. Full compiled suite: 210 tests / 579
assertions, zero failures/errors and zero compiler warnings; the existing
Mongo integration test reports unavailable authentication. Lint: zero errors
and warnings. No new test skips were added.

The executable local pair probe reads the actual eta-mu YAML staging and
observer-build steps, compiles all 22 tools, feeds the producer's manifest and
over-300-KB Git input to the compiled consumer, and verifies recovery plus a
retained Git-quoted Unicode tail finding through publisher validation. It is
under the repair evidence directory in `muse19-native-followup/`.
Until `MUSE_SOURCE_SHA` names a clean committed Muse checkout and matches all
three workflow selections, its output is source-contract evidence only.
Parent owns source commits, push, native reruns, review settlement and merges.

## Current native MiMo observation follow-up

Native MiMo review `5403657875` approved exact source `7a8788d` after all 15
changed files, while preserving two needs-human observations. The 64-character
commit-identity case was reproduced against the actual compiled filesystem
boundary: RED: 211 tests / 584 assertions, one manifest-rejection error. JavaScript
regular-expression alternation selected the 40-character prefix before
`re-matches` checked complete equality. Anchoring the full alternative repairs
this contract without changing accepted identity lengths. GREEN: 212 tests / 589
assertions, zero failures/errors; lint zero errors/warnings. The new boundary
fixture accepts complete 64-hex identities and refuses invalid lengths/suffixes.
Additional domain checks show unknown pages and blank assessment notes supply
no coverage. The existing marker-mention fixture remains non-truncated, and
actual eta workflow staging emits the anchored marker grammar at line 276.

Native Eta340 `a791f29` compiled the 22-tool profile at pinned Muse 7a
(job 111329136270), but CodeRabbit finding 4175602381 demonstrates that a
PR-executed deterministic gate can replace both full diff and manifest.
Independent clean-job Git reconstruction/comparison is being prepared; a
self-consistent producer artifact alone is not authority. No joint native
integrity qualification or caller activation is claimed. The next immutable
Muse selection invalidates previous exact-head approval and needs new native
qualification. All historical receipts and operational board state remain
untouched.
