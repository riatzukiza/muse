## Clojure House Rules

### Architecture Paradigm: Categories vs. Contracts
When modeling domains, you must strictly differentiate between the grammar of motion and the enforcement of that motion.
- Categories: Describe the space of lawful possible transformations. They dictate "what kind of move this is" and define the state space, transition vocabulary, and general laws of composition for the runtime or a subsystem.
- Contracts: Decide whether a particular runtime entity, event, or transition is admissible under current obligations. They dictate "whether you are allowed to count it as a valid move right now" by defining guards, admissibility checks, evidence requirements, delivery expectations, and side-effect constraints.


### Zero Warnings
`clj-kondo`, type checks, and tests must all pass with zero warnings. Warnings
are failed contracts, not noise.

### Namespace Architecture
| Layer         | Pattern            | Rule                             |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| `domain.*`    | Business logic     | No I/O. Pure functions only.     |
| `infra.*`     | Transport/DB/Queue | No domain policy.                |
| `shape.*`     | Data morphisms     | Pure, domain-agnostic.           |
| `law.*`       | Contracts/Malli    | No I/O. Validators only.         |

### Clojure Construction Order
Regardless of the kanban process, ClojureScript is **built in a fixed order**, because the
order *is* the dependency DAG: each layer compiles against already-defined lower layers.

```
Discovery → ( Describe → specify → define → shape → extern → domain → infra )
```

- **Discovery** — survey what already exists before constructing. Opens every cycle and
  recurs *inside* every step (see the anomaly rule below). Output: a named inventory of the
  shapes in play, including the ones that are already there.
- **Describe** — state the projection's intent in prose (a note, a kanban card body).
- **specify** — pin acceptance criteria / exit signals (the kanban "Clarify & Scope" pass).
- **define** — author the `law.*` that **describes** the shape (μ). A law is a description of
  what a valid instance is, not the data and not the transform; that is why it has no
  dependencies and comes first. (`define` and `shape` are complementary roles, not one
  artifact moved between layers — the law describes; the shape is the morphism it describes.)
- **shape** — `shape.*` pure morphisms that produce/consume the described shapes (parse,
  enrich, (de)serialize). Depends only on `law`.
- **extern** — `extern.*` raw JS / Node / browser / SDK boundaries, decoding foreign data
  into defined shapes at the edge. Nothing above `extern` touches a raw host object.
- **domain** — `domain.*` pure decisions over shaped data. Depends on `shape` + `law`.
- **infra** — `infra.*` effect orchestration composing `extern` adapters and `domain`
  decisions, returning CLJS data. Depends on everything below it.

#### The anomaly rule (a surprise at every step)
Every step is also a discovery step. You will keep finding shapes you didn't realize were
already there — in this package or a sibling.

> If the discovery does **not** invalidate the shape of your targeted projections, you
> **describe the anomaly** (location + whether it's already-there reuse or a contradiction)
> and **keep going**. If it **does** invalidate a target, stop and re-`describe` that projection.

Anomalies are logged, not silently absorbed. A worked example of a Discovery pass and its
anomaly log: `docs/rheos-chat-ui-shape-discovery.md`.

### Modern ClojureScript
Always use `^:async` metadata (ClojureScript ≥ 1.12.145). Never use
`core.async` channels or Promise chains in new code.

```clojure
(defn ^:async fetch-data [url]
  (await (js/fetch url)))

(deftest ^:async fetch-test
  (is (some? (await (fetch-data "https://example.com")))))
```

### Idioms
- `when-let` over nested `let` + `if`
- `->` / `->>` over nested `let` forms
- No `utils` namespaces
- No broad `:refer :all`
- Custom macros registered in `.clj-kondo/config.edn` on day one
## Board Operations

- **Work from a card.** Never work off-board. Anchor every implementation slice on a kanban task and record the scoped plan on the card before moving to implementation.
- **Move cards with the Rheos CLI.** Run commands from the **repo root** so the board resolves correctly:
  - `eta-mu kanban list` — current board.
  - `eta-mu kanban count` — column counts.
  - `eta-mu kanban comment <uuid> "note"` — append provenance to a card.
  - `eta-mu kanban frontmatter <uuid> status <new-status>` — lawful status change.
  - `eta-mu kanban frontmatter <uuid> status <new-status>` delegates to Rheos and runs transition gates when required.
- **Markdown authoring is first-class input.** Cards may be created and edited manually as Markdown with explicit `uuid:` identity, outcome, scope, acceptance and verification. Use comma-separated scalar labels. Manual creation does not require an invented `write-id` or `kanban.task-created` event. Rheos alone owns operational status, comments, transitions and drift reconciliation; never hand-edit an existing card status or fabricate engine events. A harness without Rheos may inspect artifacts and author card content but must not claim board validation.
- **Walk lawful hops.** There are no shortcut edges. To move a card multiple columns forward, step through each lawful transition in order. The direct `in_progress → review` edge exists only when the build-gate passes.
- **Keep provenance under `.ημ`.** The source of truth is `docs/agile/kanban` plus its `.events` symlink into `.ημ/kanban-events`. Never create a physical board ledger under `docs/`.

## Muse / Plugin Authoring

- **muse-config-authoring** — Create/modify `.ημ/config/opencode/` config trees (root.edn, plugin exposure fragments, profiles, permissions). Use when registering new plugins, adjusting tool exposure, or setting up a project's eta-mu config.
- **muse-plugin-authoring** — Write new muse plugins using the eta-mu DSL (deftool, defhook, defplugin). Use when creating new tools, hooks, or plugin bundles for the OpenCode target.
- **mcp-server-authoring** — Build MCP servers from muse plugins for Claude Code, Codex, and other MCP clients. Use when exposing tools via the Model Context Protocol.
- **claude-integration** — Set up Claude Code integration: the Claude target compiles the same DSL plugins into MCP tools + native hooks. Use when configuring how Claude Code interacts with a muse-powered repository.

## Code Style
- **ClojureScript** (all new code): Reagent components, kebab-case functions, atoms for state, Tailwind CSS
- **Types**: Strict TypeScript enabled for legacy TS; ClojureScript uses Malli schemas for validation
- **Error handling**: Try/catch only when necessary, proper error logging via bus events
- **Formatting**: Consistent indentation, no unnecessary destructuring, single-responsibility functions
